Online Shopping Cart Simulation

Files: shopper.c

This is a simulation of an online shopping cart which takes an input file
containing updates to be processed by the program. 

The program is executed with the command "shopper file_name.txt", where 
file_name is any arbitrary name. Any extra files passed as an argument
will be ignored, and no error will be thrown. However, an error will be
thrown if there are no files passed as an argument.

The program expects files to be formatted as per the following example:
ITEM	  2
iTem	  5
ITem2	  10
iTEM3	  -5
item2	  -20
iteM3	  20
item	  3

Item names should not contain spaces and should not be longer than 120
characters. If the item name is not followed by an integer, it is 
considered a formatting error. However, if the line contains more 
characters of any kind after a correctly formatted item-number pair, 
those extraneous characters are ignored.

Upon encountering a line that does not contain a properly formatted
item-number pair, the program will print an error message and then 
continue reading the file. 

Blank lines are ignored.
